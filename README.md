# WhatsUpOfficial

This is a project made at school, that uses an API that requires credentials, so the access is private.
But I can list the features:
- Connection
- Deconnection
- Post a message
- Delete your messages
- Update your messages
- Ignore people
- See the "blacklist"
- Remove people from your blacklist to display again their messages
